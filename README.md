## What is `studimhotep`?
It is a collection of  tools i use when analysing the IMHOTEP project data. You'll find some tutorials, example notebooks and scripts, and a library of functions.

Beware that these codes are still under development as the IMHOTEP project is on going. It is not yet meant to be a clean and stand-alone package at this stage.
